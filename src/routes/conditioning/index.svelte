If you’ve ever considered installing Central Air Conditioning, A/C or HVAC system, there’s never a better time than now. Low prices, Energy Star rebates and high efficiency air conditioners are more affordable than ever. Improvements on compressor technology and fan blade shapes on most units make less than 1/10 the noise of old units. The average HVAC unit 20 years ago utilized 6,000 watts of electricity per hour to cool the average home. Today, that same home can be kept cool with as little as 1,800 watts per hour. Technology has introduced many innovative features, such as programmable thermostats, allowing you to control your homes temperature even while you’re on vacation.
